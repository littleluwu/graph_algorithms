# **📚 Applications of popular Graph Algorithms**

This repository contemplates the studies of popular graph algorithms and their properties applied to contextual problems and practical applications. The chosen algorithms for review and the situations in which to implement them are based on the class `1001323 - ALGORITMOS EM GRAFOS`, lectured by professor **Cândida N. da Silva** at the **Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos - Campus Sorocaba**.

## 🗂️ General Organization

We investigate graph properties in five classical problems in graph theory, where each application has its folder in this repository. They are numbered from one to five, followed by the name according to the problem they refer to. Inside each folder, we have the problem description with its context, the given input, and the expected output. Two example cases are available in the problem description, and the open test cases are in the **in** and **out** folders.

## 📝 Brief details of the Applications

### Bipartite Verification

A graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycle. Thus, to verify if a given graph is bipartite, we check the occurrences of odd cycles using a modified depth-first search.
